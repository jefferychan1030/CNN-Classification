# CNN-Classification

# Problem Statement
This is a multi-class classification dataset from Kaggle featuring over 25,000 images of 150 X 150 distributed across 6 categories:
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5} 
Originally created by Intel, the idea is to feed and train our traditional CNN model as well as some pre-trained models in order to make correct prediction. Along the way, we'll also test and compare various DL models using classification metrics.
